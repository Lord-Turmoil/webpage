                <p>This is the most complicated project I've ever done. With all the knowledge of C++, I could finish
                    this. As my first implementation of a shabby game enigne, I practiced some basic design patterns,
                    and for the first time experienced the convenience of adding or removing features in component
                    pattern, or the ECS mode. Fun, it is, to do such stuff.

            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>I imagined such a project to resemble Soul Knight even before the previous project -
                    <a href="jumper.html" target="_blank">Jumper</a>, but was afraid to do this because of lack of
                    experience. After that, however, the voice within called me, and Dungeon was born.
                </p>
                <p>Many things happened during this project, and it turned out to be a mixture of complex feelings.
                    Thinking back for version 0.1.0, so eager was I to create something different, but not aware of good
                    design, thus it was a failure from the very beginning :D. However, it was very successful, as it
                    taught me the harm of bad code.
                </p>
                <p>Then, things started to change. Inspired by the ease of use of component in Unity, I decided to
                    create an engine for my own. It was so promising, and with the failure before, I was aware of the
                    traps of a large project. To invest more into this, New Desire Studios was established, to fully
                    dedicate to this mission. And the engine got a perfect name - DUNGINE! (DUNGeon enGINE)
                </p>
                <p>With the primary structure partly remained, every thing went well, except that the schedule got a
                    little delay. The project "physically" started on March 31, I think? Shortly after, The barnacle
                    programmer got infatuated, and naively thought it could last long as his code would be. Perhaps this
                    was one of the most ecstatic time for the poor guy.
                </p>
                <p>It took us longer than we expected. We didn't make it within the summer holiday. However, it got a
                    chance to become the project for the transitional semester. My peers were great, and they made
                    great works. BUT, they use game engine to realize fancy effects! Gaining an advantage of self
                    written Dungine, I'm lucky to be the No.1, with Dungeon v1.0.0 released. Sadly, not all of my
                    initial thoughts were realized.
                </p>
                <p>The potential of Dungine was not fully discovered yet, however. As time went by, more and more
                    features were added to it, and it became more and more complete. Suddenly, without warning, like an
                    Atomic Holocaust, the poor programmer got broke up, so upset and lost that the whole project came to
                    a halt. "Excruciating pain." He recalled, and tried to mend this by launching a new webpage, but at
                    last, he didn't got the courage, even the webpage was ready in all the way. He just asked the
                    Studios to make a GIF with, by then, a classified image.
                </p>
                <p>As Christmas approching, the development came to the final touch. The engine almost reached its full
                    potential. So, I think, this is it, right? Just practice and enjoy coding, and this is enough. Now,
                    I guess, it's time to prepare for the ultimate release. :)
